Cold Brew Coffee:
Make according to the makers instructions. 
My recipe using example maker:
1. Coarsely grind Starbucks Espresso Roast whole bean coffee
2. Fill maker almost to the top with cold filtered water (I just use the fridge)
3. Fill basket with coffee grounds almost to the top and slowly lower into the maker. 
4. Swirl/shake the maker once clolsed.
5. Brew in the fridge for at least 24 hours. Ocassionally take out and shake/swirl the maker.

Nitro Coffee: 
1. Mix 50/50 water and cold brew coffee in the wipped cream dispenser.
2. Close up the dispenser, add a nitrogen charger, and turn upside down then rightside up several times.
3. Put some ice in a glass/tumbler. 
4. Turn the dispenser upside down and gently release the coffee (if you squeeze the trigger too hard you will get sprayed)
