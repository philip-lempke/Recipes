Ingredients

2 Tbsp. olive oil
1 small sweet onion coarsely chopped
1 lb. ground turkey 93/7
4 cups sweet potatoes peeled and cut into ½-inch cubes
2 Tbsp. chili powder
2 tsp. cumin
1 tsp. paprika can use smoked paprika if you prefer
2 tsp. salt
¾ tsp. pepper
1/8 tsp. cinnamon
28 oz. crushed tomatoes canned
1 cup chicken broth or water
15 oz. sweet whole kernel corn canned, drained
15 oz. black beans canned, drained
Tortilla chips optional
Cilantro optional
Sour cream optional
Cooked rice optional


Instructions

In a large saucepan, or large shallow pot, drizzle olive oil. Add onions and saute over medium heat for 2-3 minutes.
Push onions to the side and add ground turkey. Continue cooking over medium heat for 6-8 minutes, or until turkey is almost cooked through.
Add sweet potatoes and saute for another 2 minutes.
In a small bowl combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt and pepper. Mix to combine.
Pour crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and pre-mixed seasoning ingredients into the chili mixture. Mix chili thoroughly and reduce heat to a simmer.
Cover pot and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
Add drained corn and black beans. Cover and simmer for an additional 5-10 minutes.
Check to see if sweet potatoes are fork-tender before serving. If you would like a slightly thicker chili, mash some of the sweet potatoes to help thicken it.
Serve chili over rice with corn chips, cilantro and sour cream
