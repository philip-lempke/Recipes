Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. 

Peel off any yellowed or wilted leaves from the outside of Brussels sprouts and trim bottoms.

Halve any that are the size of walnuts or larger.

For lame people: Place on a rimmed baking sheet, drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Toss until coated. 
For cool people: Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. Cook bacon on baking sheet until crispy and set aside. Put burssels sprouts in the bacon grease. Sprinkle with pepper. 

Roast, stirring once or twice, until sprouts are browned and just tender when pierced at the base with a paring knife, about 25 minutes. 

Drizzle with maple syrup and toss with pumpkin seeds. Roast 5 more minutes until pumpkin seeds are just toasted. 

Cool people: add crushed bacon.
