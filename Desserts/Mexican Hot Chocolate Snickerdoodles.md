Makes 2 dozen Cookies


For the topping:

- 1/3 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon


For the cookies:

- 1/2 cup canola oil
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup pure maple syrup
- 3 tablespoons almond milk (Or preferred non-dairy milk)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon chocolate extract (or more vanilla extract)
- 1 2/3 cups flour
- 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon cayenne


## Instructions

TIP: When measuring oil, measure the maple syrup at the same time so it doesn't stick to the measuring cup. 


Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.

Mix the topping ingredients together on a flat plate. Set aside.

In a medium mixing bowl, use a fork to vigorously mix together oil, sugar, syrup and milk. Mix in extracts.

Sift in remaining ingredients, stirring as you add them. Once all ingredients are added, mix until youâ€™ve got a pliable dough.

Roll dough into walnut-sized balls. Pat into the sugar topping to flatten into roughly 2-inch discs. Transfer to baking sheet, sugar side up, at least 2 inches apart. Bake for 10-12 minutes, they should be crackly on top. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack.
