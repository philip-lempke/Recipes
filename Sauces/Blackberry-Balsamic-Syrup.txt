COOK TIME: 10 MINUTES

INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup Balsamic Vinegar
2 tablespoons brown sugar
1/2 cup fresh blackberries

INSTRUCTIONS
Heat the balsamic vinegar, sugar and blackberries in a small pan over a low-medium heat for about 10 minutes until it coats the back of a spoon like syrup.

(Optional) Strain the vinegar mixture into a small bowl pushing the blackberries with the spoon to retrieve as much liquid as possible.

Use on salt and peppered steak with blue cheese crumbles.
